    <h1>Untitled yEAh Site</h1>
    <p>
      Using yAtch, a block-based block-code-to-HTML compiler, learn to build
      your own website using Scratch-like block code, then host it for free on yEAh Sites with
      your yEAh Account.
      The build environment is on the left. Start dragging in blocks to
      construct your webpage. Follow our yAtch tutorial in the bottom left to learn the
      basics.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the right, you can see a live, rendered preview of your yAtch
      code compiled to HTML and the compiled code itself.
